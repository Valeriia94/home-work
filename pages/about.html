        <span style="font-weight: bold;">On my birthday </span>
        I had no idea that this day would change my life. 
        The morning began as usual—with congratulations from family and friends, 
        a delicious cake, and gifts. But the main surprise awaited me later. 
        When everyone gathered in the living room, my parents approached me with shining eyes, 
        holding a small box with holes in it. I lifted the lid, and two tiny, curious eyes 
        stared back at me—it was a Jack Russell Terrier puppy. I immediately felt that 
        this puppy wasn't just a gift but a true friend. Small, white with brown spots, 
        she instantly started wagging her tail and nudging my hand with her little nose. 
        I hugged her, and she licked my cheek as if confirming that she felt the same. 
        I decided to name her Jessy—a name that perfectly suited such an energetic and adorable creature.
        
        At first, Jessy brought me not only joy but also a bit of trouble. 
        She was incredibly active and curious, running around the house, climbing on the furniture, 
        and trying to chew on everything in sight. Every morning began with Jessy jumping up to my bed, 
        inviting me to play. But over time, I learned how to channel her energy: together, 
        we started going for walks in the park, playing fetch, and teaching her different 
        commands. With each passing day, our bond grew stronger. Jessy was always by my side—whether I
        was feeling sad or happy. She quickly became my most loyal companion. 
        Evenings were spent on the couch, with her curling up on my lap, tired after a day of playing outside.
        
        Since then, Jessy has become an inseparable part of my life. 
        She brought joy, laughter, and a sense of true friendship. Every day 
        spent with her reminds me of the precious gift I received on that birthday—not just a dog, 
        but a true friend for years to come.
