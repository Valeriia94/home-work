# Project Title: Jessica's Life Website

## Project Description
This website is dedicated to my dog, Jessica. It showcases photos that capture her daily adventures, favorite moments, and memories we share together. Each photo is accompanied by a short story that tells about Jessica’s character and our time together.

## Features

- **Photo Gallery**: Visitors can browse photo albums from different stages of Jessica’s life.
- **Life Stories**: Each photo or event is paired with an interesting story or description.

## Additional Information

This project was inspired by Jessica's unique personality and the joy she brings to everyone around her. With this website, I aim to preserve our precious memories and share her journey with others who may appreciate her spirit and joy for life. The stories are written to show not only Jessica's character but also the bond we share, highlighting how pets bring love and companionship into our lives.

In the future, I plan to expand the website with interactive elements, such as a section where visitors can share their own pet stories or leave messages. This way, Jessica’s story can bring together a community of animal lovers, celebrating the joy our pets bring to us every day.
